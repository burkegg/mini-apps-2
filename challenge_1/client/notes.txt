json server docs

the part htat shows you how to write your own serer using json-server.

That's necess. for your own custom endpoint

you query the database form teh endpoint

some queries will work without any setup.

try querying a json-server before writing your own.

tricky part:  also need the length of data for pagination without returning all of the data to your client.

that's why you write your own server, have the server do a query to the server, then it returns data, you return the length so your client knnows how many pages to show.
